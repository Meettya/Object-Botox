Object-Botox

Object::Botox writed for easy object creation by default constructor and support managment properties,
inherited by children of prototyping class.

To create parent module:
   
	package Parent;

	use Botox;
        
  # strictly named constant PROTOTYPE !
	use constant PROTOTYPE => {
                'prop1_ro' => 1 ,
                'prop2' => 'abcde'
                };
	
	1; 

after that we are create instanse:

	package main;
	use Data::Dumper;
	
	# change default value for prop1
	my $foo = new Parent( { prop1 => 888888 } );
	
	print Dumper($foo);

outputs get to us:

	$VAR1 = bless( {
			'Parent::prop1' => 888888,
			'Parent::prop2' => 'abcde'
			 }, 'Parent' );

ok, in short it is like Mouse, but simple.
